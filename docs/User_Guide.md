- [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Getting Started

To start using ANNOS, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the ANNOS repository and install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ANNOS.git
cd ANNOS
npm install
```

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file.

## Configuration

The ANNOS platform can be configured using the `.env` file. Here are the available configuration options:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: The level of logging.
- `GENETIC_ALGORITHM_POPULATION_SIZE`: The population size for the genetic algorithm.
- `REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_EPSILON`: The epsilon value for the reinforcement learning algorithm.

## API Usage

The ANNOS platform provides two main APIs: the Optimization API and the Neural Network API.

### Optimization API

The Optimization API is used to start the optimization process. It can be accessed at `/api/optimization/start`. The API accepts a POST request with the following parameters:

- `algorithm`: The optimization algorithm to use. It can be either `genetic` or `reinforcement`.
- `task`: The specific task for which the neural network should be optimized.

### Neural Network API

The Neural Network API is used to manage neural networks. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, and evaluating neural networks.

## Error Handling

In case of any errors, the ANNOS platform will return an error response with a status code and a message describing the error. The error messages are logged in the console and can be used for debugging purposes.

For more detailed information, please refer to the API documentation and the technical overview.

Thank you for using ANNOS. We hope this guide helps you in effectively using the platform.
